# Spatial Interpolation Methods for Weather Data

## Overview

This document outlines the research and design decisions for implementing spatial interpolation methods for point-based weather data in the Meteostat Python library.

## Background

Weather data is collected at discrete weather stations, but users often need data at specific geographic locations where no station exists. Spatial interpolation estimates values at unmeasured locations based on values from nearby stations.

## Interpolation Methods

### 1. Nearest Neighbor (Already Implemented)

**Method**: Uses the value from the closest weather station.

**Advantages**:
- Simple and fast
- Preserves actual measured values
- No assumptions about spatial correlation

**Disadvantages**:
- Discontinuous (abrupt changes at boundaries)
- Ignores information from other nearby stations
- Can be inaccurate if nearest station is far or at different elevation

**Use Case**: When the nearest station is very close (<5km) and at similar elevation (<50m difference).

### 2. Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)

**Method**: Estimates values as a weighted average of nearby stations, where weights decrease with distance.

**Formula**:
```
Z(x) = Σ(wi * Zi) / Σ(wi)
where wi = 1 / (di^p)
```
- Z(x) = interpolated value at location x
- Zi = value at station i
- di = distance from x to station i
- p = power parameter (typically 2)

**With Elevation Consideration**:
We use a modified distance metric that incorporates both horizontal distance and elevation difference:

```
effective_distance = sqrt(horizontal_distance^2 + (elevation_diff * elevation_weight)^2)
```

**Advantages**:
- Smooth interpolation
- Considers multiple nearby stations
- Well-established method in meteorology
- Can incorporate elevation differences

**Disadvantages**:
- Can oversmooth data
- Sensitive to power parameter choice
- May not capture local variations well

**Use Case**: General-purpose interpolation when multiple stations are available within reasonable distance.

### 3. Machine Learning-Based Interpolation

**Method**: Uses a Random Forest Regressor trained on spatial features to predict weather values.

**Features**:
- Latitude
- Longitude  
- Elevation
- Distance to nearest stations
- Values from k-nearest stations
- Temporal features (day of year, hour)

**Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- Handles non-linear relationships
- Robust to outliers
- Can capture complex spatial patterns
- Works well with limited data

**Advantages**:
- Can capture complex spatial relationships
- Automatically learns importance of elevation
- Can incorporate additional features
- Generally more accurate than simple methods

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires training data
- More computationally expensive
- Less interpretable
- May require tuning

**Use Case**: When high accuracy is needed and computational cost is acceptable.

### 4. Auto (Hybrid Approach)

**Method**: Intelligently selects between Nearest Neighbor and IDW based on spatial context.

**Decision Logic**:
```
IF nearest_station_distance <= 5000m AND elevation_difference <= 50m:
    USE nearest_neighbor
ELSE:
    USE IDW with elevation weighting
```

**Rationale**:
- When a very close station exists at similar elevation, its measurement is likely most accurate
- For more distant stations or significant elevation differences, averaging multiple stations (IDW) is better
- Balances accuracy and computational efficiency

**Advantages**:
- Adaptive to local conditions
- Simple and interpretable
- Good default choice
- Fast

**Disadvantages**:
- Arbitrary thresholds (though based on meteorological principles)
- May not be optimal in all cases

**Use Case**: Default method for general-purpose interpolation.

## Elevation Considerations

Weather variables, especially temperature, are strongly correlated with elevation. The standard environmental lapse rate is approximately 6.5°C per 1000m elevation gain.

**Implementation**:
1. For temperature variables, apply lapse rate adjustment (already implemented)
2. For IDW, use 3D distance metric that weights elevation difference
3. For ML methods, include elevation as a key feature

## Performance Benchmarks

Benchmarks should compare:
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Computational time
- Memory usage

Test locations:
- Frankfurt, Germany (flat terrain)
- Denver, USA (mountainous)
- Singapore (tropical coastal)
- Multiple weather variables (temp, precipitation, etc.)

## Implementation Notes

1. All methods should handle missing data gracefully
2. Methods should work with both single points and multiple points
3. Performance should be optimized for typical use cases (1-10 nearby stations)
4. API should allow custom interpolation functions for advanced users

## Conclusion

Each interpolation method has trade-offs. The "Auto" method provides a good default, while specialized methods (IDW, ML) offer improvements for specific use cases. The implementation provides flexibility while maintaining ease of use.
